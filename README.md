# House Prices Prediction - Advanced Regression Techniques

A machine learning project focused on predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques, feature engineering, and production-oriented pipelines.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data exploration to reusable preprocessing and model pipelines.

Using the Ames Housing dataset, multiple regression models were developed and optimized to predict residential property prices. The final selected model was XGBoost, achieving strong predictive performance.

The superior performance of XGBoost highlights the importance of capturing nonlinear relationships and feature interactions in housing data.
