    "Excellent idea! The data description file is crucial for understanding what each feature actually means and how to interpret those outliers and patterns we've been seeing. Let me read through it and provide insights.\n",
    "Reviewing the numerical summaries, I identified major outliers and skewed distributions, indicating potential data quality issues. Many high values seem to be genuine, but some suspicious entries (e.g., large basement sizes, unusual bedrooms) require further checks. The patterns support extensive feature engineering opportunities, such as creating age, total area, ratio, and binary indicators. Next, I will review the feature descriptions to better understand feature meanings and outlier implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've learned that many outliers are legitimate, such as large lot sizes and multiple kitchens, reflecting different property types. Missing data often indicates absence (e.g., no pool or garage). Features like quality and condition are ordinal, useful for encoding. The detailed data description confirms which features are categorical, ordinal, or continuous, guiding proper preprocessing. Next, I'll focus on proper data type conversions, handle missing values, and create new features like house age and total area for better modeling.\n",
